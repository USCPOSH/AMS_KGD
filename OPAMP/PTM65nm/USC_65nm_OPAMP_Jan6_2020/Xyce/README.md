# README
There are 2 versions of the netlist:
## test_opamp.cir
This netlist can be used to compute gain from V(dolout) as a post-process in gnuplot.
## test_opamp_gain.cir
This netlist computes gain directly so it doesnâ€™t need a post-process step.
## Gain and IM3 scripts
The included m-files should be compatible with GNU Octave (<https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/>), which is open-source under the GNU GPL license (<https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/license.html>).

For plotting the gain (done here for the op-amp), the included scripts aren't necessary, as the relevant result is simply in the .prn file produced by Xyce. For plotting the IM3 calculation, however, these scripts are needed to compute the FFT and plot. The main script to run is specXyce.m, which calls plotXyce.m.
