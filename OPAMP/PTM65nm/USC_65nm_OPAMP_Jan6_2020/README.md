# Xyce-compatibility
There are 2 versions of the netlist, located in the "Xyce" folder: test_opamp.cir and test_opamp_gain.cir
## test_opamp.cir
This netlist can be used to compute gain from V(dolout) as a post-process in gnuplot.
## test_opamp_gain.cir
This netlist computes gain directly so it doesnâ€™t need a post-process step.
